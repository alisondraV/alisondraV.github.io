				<p>Emojillite is a tool for people to explore major satellites that orbit Earth and discover the data they are
					collecting.</p>
				<p>Emojillite uses emojis to visualize the real-time satellite data as well as their positioning to entertain and
					educate
					people on what data is collected and what it is used for.</p>
				<p>I was working on this project on the hackathon "Space Apps" in autumn, 2019 with some of my friends.</p>
				<a href="http://emojillite.herokuapp.com/">Have a look at the satellites now!</a>
